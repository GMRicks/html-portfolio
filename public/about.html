<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Improvement is the only thing that keeps me going in this demanding world. I have the attitude that I must always be learning, even in the most trying circumstances. My brain feels dead if I don't feed it with anything new, so I want to learn something new every day. I keep pushing myself harder if I see that something holds potential. I enjoy playing chess, exploring new things, listening to music. I also like to keep a personal journal to understand myself better.</p>
