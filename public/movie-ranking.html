<h2>My Top 3 Movies of all time</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Big Short</h3>
<p>
It is a movie based on the 2008 subprime crisis taking place in the USA. This movie perfectly gravitates around the character.
Michael Bury, who takes advantage of this opportunity to short the market and get profit out of it, This movie talks about
complex terms like MBS and CDS, which are key financial derivatives that helped Michael Bury earn profits. Gotta say this
is one of my best movies of all time.

<h3>The Wolf of the Wall Street</h3>
<p>
     This movie is based on Jordan Belfort, a person who got caught pulling crazy
    shenanigans. Throughout the movie, I got a pump of adrenaline, and it managed to keep me hooked the entire time.
    Also, Leo's acting was an add-on :)

<h3>Scam 1992</h3>
<p>
   This is not a movie. It is a series, but hands down, this is again one of the best things I have ever watched.
This series is based on a true story. It is a biography of Harshad Mehta, an Indian stock broker who exploited
the loopholes in the market. This series showcases how he became one of the richest people in India back then, in the
1990s from being a pauper who lived in the slums of Mumbai.
